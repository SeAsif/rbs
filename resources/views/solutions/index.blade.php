	  <p>
		A retirement income plan should include guaranteed income, growth potential, and flexibility. As part of your income strategy, we suggest that you should make part of your income tax free.

	</p>
	<br/>
    
<p>
		Of course, the challenge is to find a financial vehicle that will allow you to accomplish this without sacrificing other important goals. We have discovered an innovative approach in retirement planning that combines a number of the following powerful features:


	</p>
	<br/>
	
<ol type="1">
  <li>Principal protection</li>
  <li> Market-linked growth</li>
  <li>Tax-free accumulation</li>
  <li>Tax-free access for major expenditures</li>
  <li>Tax-free access for long term care</li>
  <li>Tax-free access for retirement income</li>
  <li>Tax-free cash to your family or business partners</li>
</ol>	

<p>
Your income strategy should provide guarantees – like a guaranteed stream of income – to help your plan succeed, flexibility to allow you options, and growth potential to meet your long-term needs. You worked hard and saved diligently for retirement. You need a strategy to generate income that can last your entire lifetime.
</p>
	
	<p class="heading">Guaranteed Income:</p>
	<p>
 Guaranteed Income is a fixed income stream regardless of what the markets (or world events) are doing. Insurance companies may offer more conservative products that offer a fixed income each year.
</p>
	
<p class="heading">Flexibility:</p>
<p>Willingness to be flexible with spending is “absolutely key” both before and during retirement. Flexibility is the key to success in how long a portfolio supports the retiree.</p>

	<p class="heading">Growth Potential:</p>
<p>As you build your income plan, it's important to include some investments with growth potential that may help keep up with inflation through the years.</p><br/>
